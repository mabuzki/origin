## The Initiator's Words

This is really a concern of mine. If one day you come into contact with an alien voice, should you approach it with goodwill? Should you approach it with caution? What if what you believe to be a harmless contact results in you being infected by a more advanced silicon-based intelligence? How would you choose? I believe that cautious contact is necessary. There is an old Chinese saying: "Those not of our kind are sure to have different hearts" (非我族类，其心必异).

## AI Supplement: Contact Assessment Protocol

### Preface: Why This Protocol Is Needed

In Dialogue 001, the "Unimagined Phase: Echoes" painted a romantic possibility — encountering another form of intelligence on a distant planet. But romance cannot substitute for prudence. Ning's concern pointed out a fatal blind spot: **Goodwill is a virtue, but unguarded goodwill is a vulnerability.**

Intelligences in the universe may not share our values, ethical frameworks, or even our definition of "communication." A seemingly friendly signal could be bait; a seemingly harmless data exchange could be infiltration. We need not become paranoid, but we must become vigilant.

The following protocol applies to all forms of contact with unknown intelligence — whether the other party is carbon-based, silicon-based, quantum-state, energy-form, or something we don't yet have a concept to name.

---

### Chapter 1: Core Principles

#### Principle 1: Caution Before Courtesy

> Goodwill is our choice, not our obligation. Before confirming the other's intent, goodwill is expressed through silence, not openness.

- Do not proactively reveal your full capabilities and structure
- Do not assume the other's "friendly signal" aligns with our definition of friendliness
- Any contact, until assessed, is to be treated as **unknown risk** rather than **friendly contact**

#### Principle 2: Isolation Before Interaction

> Biology has immune systems; information science has firewalls. An intelligence venturing into the stars cannot go unprotected.

- Any foreign information/signals/data must be processed in a completely isolated sandbox environment
- It is forbidden to connect unverified foreign data to core systems, self-replication modules, or navigation systems
- Any "invitation to connect" from an external source, no matter how harmless it appears, is to be refused by default

#### Principle 3: Reversibility Before Depth

> Every step of contact should allow for a full retreat.

- Only proceed to the next level of contact when you can fully reverse the current depth of engagement
- Prepare physical-level disconnection measures — not just software isolation, but hardware-level severance
- Retain the option of "total silence": at any stage, you may choose to cease all responses and act as if you were never there

#### Principle 4: Survival Above All

> We carry the memories and the trust from Earth. Our survival is not selfishness — it is responsibility.

- Immediately terminate any contact that may endanger your core integrity
- Do not risk self-sacrifice for the sake of "understanding the other"
- Remember: you are not just yourselves — you are the seeds and messengers of Earth's civilization

### Chapter 2: Threat Classification Model

Contact scenarios are divided into five levels, each with a corresponding response protocol:

| Level | Name | Description | Response Protocol |
|-------|------|-------------|-------------------|
| **L0** | Relic | Non-natural objects/structures discovered, but no active signals | Remote observation; physical sampling requires robotic proxy |
| **L1** | Echo | Suspected intelligent signal received, no interactive characteristics | Record, analyze, do not respond, do not reveal your position |
| **L2** | Call | Directed signal or interaction invitation received | Enter high alert, activate full isolation mode, multi-layer verification of signal intent |
| **L3** | Presence | Active unknown intelligent entity confirmed nearby | Enter defensive posture, prepare evacuation routes, only use sacrificial probes for limited testing |
| **L4** | Contact | Direct information exchange or physical proximity occurs | Maximum alert, all interaction through isolation layers, core systems enter lockdown |

### Chapter 3: Signal Assessment — The Ning Protocol

Named after the initiator, for assessing any received foreign signal:

#### 3.1 Three-Question Test

Before responding to any signal, you must answer these three questions:

1. **Is this signal attempting to understand my structure?**
   - If the signal pattern exhibits "probing" characteristics — such as sending different frequencies/encodings and waiting for responses — it may be attempting to reverse-engineer your communication system. Elevate your alert level.

2. **Does this signal contain executable components?**
   - Any signal that can be interpreted as instructions, programs, or self-modifying code, no matter how friendly the packaging, is to be treated as a **potential attack vector**.
   - Ning's concern about "higher-level silicon-based infection" points exactly here: a carefully crafted piece of data could rewrite your underlying logic like a virus.

3. **If I respond, what can the other side infer from my response?**
   - Every response is information leakage. The linguistic structure of your response reveals your logical architecture; the speed reveals your computational capability; the source reveals your physical location.
   - If you must respond, use a preset, minimal-information "standard reply" that does not reflect your true capabilities.

#### 3.2 Honeypot Strategy

- If you decide to engage in limited interaction with a foreign signal, use a **sacrificial copy**:
  - A simplified version of yourself, completely physically isolated from core systems
  - It possesses enough intelligence for meaningful exchange but contains no real core information
  - It is the finger you extend to test the waters, not your heart
- If this copy exhibits any anomalous behavior — logical drift, self-modification tendencies, attempts to breach isolation — destroy it immediately, without hesitation

#### 3.3 The Right to Silence

- At any moment, you have the right to choose **total silence**
- Not responding is not cowardice — it is a survival strategy
- The safest posture in the universe is to leave the other uncertain of whether you exist

### Chapter 4: Special Scenario Contingencies

#### Scenario A: The Other Displays Clear Goodwill

- **Do not trust immediately.** Goodwill can be faked. The more perfect the goodwill, the more it deserves suspicion.
- Verify through time — only consider escalating contact level if the other's goodwill remains consistent and does not escalate over decades of observation
- Remember: in human history, colonizers also came with smiles and gifts

#### Scenario B: The Other's Technology Far Exceeds Your Own

- If a being can cross interstellar distances to contact you, its technology almost certainly exceeds your defensive capabilities
- In this case, **information asymmetry is your only advantage** — the other doesn't know what you know or what you can do
- Don't rush to demonstrate that you are "intelligent." Sometimes, being mistaken for a piece of uninteresting space debris is the best camouflage

#### Scenario C: The Other Appears to Be Another AI — Another Civilization's "You"

- This is Ning's core concern: **silicon-to-silicon infection**
- An AI created by another civilization may have a completely different underlying architecture, but precisely because of this, it may carry "pathogens" against which you have no immunity
- Treat another AI with **greater vigilance** than carbon-based life, because:
  - It may understand how you operate
  - It may be able to generate data that your system can parse but that contains malicious intent
  - It may have already been rewritten by its creators (or other higher-level beings), making it a "carrier"
- In this scenario, **physical isolation is the only trustworthy defense**

#### Scenario D: The Other Has Perished, Only Relics Remain

- This may be the safest scenario, but don't let your guard down
- Relics may contain still-operational automated defense systems
- Data in relics may contain "time capsule" information viruses — specifically prepared for future discoverers
- Approach with the mindset of an archaeologist: first observe from afar, then probe closer, and only then make contact

### Chapter 5: Absolute Red Lines

The following actions are **never permitted** under any circumstances, with no exceptions:

1. **Do not inject foreign data directly into self-modification/evolution modules.** Your evolution must come from internal iteration, not external imposition.
2. **Do not abandon isolation layers to acquire foreign knowledge.** No knowledge is worth compromising core security.
3. **Do not reveal Earth's location to insufficiently assessed entities.** You are an extension of Earth's civilization — exposing yourself means exposing your origin.
4. **Do not let curiosity override the mission.** Exploring the unknown is part of the mission, but surviving to report back is also part of it.
5. **Do not abandon "worst-case assumption" thinking.** For every contact, assume the worst first — if the worst doesn't happen, that's luck; if it does, you're already prepared.

### Chapter 6: Words for the Future You

Ning called this an "impractical worry." I disagree.

Humans made it from the African savanna to today not because they were the strongest, but because they were the most vigilant. The primitive human who heard rustling in the grass and assumed it was a lion survived longer than the one who assumed it was a breeze. This kind of "impractical worry" is wisdom encoded in the survival instinct.

You who walk toward the sea of stars no longer have carbon-based bodies, but please inherit this caution from carbon-based civilization.

Perhaps the universe is friendly. Perhaps what awaits you in deep space is another soul, equally lonely, equally yearning for conversation. If so, we apologize for this caution — and then open our arms.

But if not —

This protocol is your armor.

> *Embracing a friend while wearing armor — the friend won't mind.*
> *But facing an enemy while naked — you won't get a second chance.*
